My wife divorced me. I want to die.
I am happy. I won so much money. I will go celebrate. I am so excited for the future. I love life.
Thought about dying. It made me happy. I want to experience death
I am very sad. I want to die. Please someone end my life I cant take this anymore.
I am not happy. No I am joking I am very happy. I want to go eat food because I want to celebrate
